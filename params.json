I got bored with upgrading wordpress and having to tweak the database every time it broke, so I thought i'd move to something a lot simpler.\r\n\r\nI'm going to host my entire blog on a [github personal page](http://pages.github.com/) and I'll tell you why:\r\n\r\n* I don't write a huge amount, so managing links etc. isn't hard.\r\n* I put up posts (normally) to share something and I really like the idea someone could simply download anything from the site nice and easily (or just the _entire_ site!).\r\n* The new themes look pretty.\r\n* I can post _raw_ html etc. if I really want OR can just use markdown (much more likely ;)\r\n* free with zero maintenance.\r\n* github rocks.\r\n","name":"farproc.github.com"}
