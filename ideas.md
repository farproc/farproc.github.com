### {{ page.title }}

I thought I'd just put down a few project ideas I have, but will probably never get around too. Feel free to nick any of the ideas - but I'd love to know if you're going to work on any of them, let me know (raise an [issue](https://github.com/farproc/farproc.github.com/issues)).

* gitFS - a FUSE file-system that maps a/all branches/tags to file-system. Maybe just read-only. Would be very cool.
* package [gitlab](http://gitlabhq.com/) for ubuntu - I freakin love github, but sometimes its nice to host your code yourself. [gitlab](http://gitlabhq.com/) isn't as polished, but its still very nice, just a little painful to install.
