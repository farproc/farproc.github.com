### {{ page.title }}

I've had a wordpress blog for years - didn't make a huge amount of posts, but I had one nether the less. I got bored with upgrading wordpress and having to tweak the database every time it broke, so I thought i'd move to something a lot simpler. I'm going to host my entire blog on a [github personal page](http://pages.github.com/) and I'll tell you why:

* Managing posts with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) is really cool - they're just files see the [\_posts](https://github.com/farproc/farproc.github.com/tree/master/_posts/) directory.
* I can post articles just just __pushing__ a single file.
* I put up posts (normally) to share something and I really like the idea someone could simply download anything from the site nice and easily (or just the _entire_ site!).
* The new themes look pretty.
* I can post _raw_ html etc. if I really want OR can just use markdown (much more likely ;)
* free with zero maintenance.
* github rocks!
