### {{ page.title }}

I've had a wordpress blog for years - didn't make a huge about of posts, but I had one nether the less. I got bored with upgrading wordpress and having to tweak the database every time it broke, so I thought i'd move to something a lot simpler.

I'm going to host my entire blog on a [github personal page](http://pages.github.com/) and I'll tell you why:

* I don't write a huge amount, so managing links etc. isn't hard.
* I put up posts (normally) to share something and I really like the idea someone could simply download anything from the site nice and easily (or just the _entire_ site!).
* The new themes look pretty.
* I can post _raw_ html etc. if I really want OR can just use markdown (much more likely ;)
* free with zero maintenance.
* github rocks.
