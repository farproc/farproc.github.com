### {{ page.title }}

I used to have a old blog which I called _devBlog_ but it lived on a few different hosts during its life time. A few of the articles were quite popular, so I've copied them over to this new site. Where possible I've kept the date the same as the original post - hopefully making it clear a few are a little out of date ;) The postings are:

* [Cracking WEP with packet injection](/2008/02/03/Cracking-WEP-with-packet-injection-on-a-macbook.html)
* [Buffer Overflows 101](2007/12/03/Buffer-Overflows-101.html)
